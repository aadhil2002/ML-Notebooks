      "point of limitation is decided against the plaintiff it leads to the determination\n",

      "of this case, as in this case point relating to the issue of limitation has been\n",

      "9. Mr. Kasliwal, in the alternative, submitted before me that in case the\n",

      "\"In a composite suit before a suit for possession and for arrears of rent\n",

      "monetary relief.\n",
      "Held, there was final adjudication on the issue of possessions and this\n",
      "determination amounts to a decree. There is obvious difference\n",

      "There can be more than one final decree in a suit where two or more\n",
      "causes of action are joined together.\"\n",
      "12. Mr. Sharma has also cited before me the case of State of Rajasthan v.\n",
      "Chander Singh (7) in which this Court has held as under :-\n",

      "13. I have heard the luminaries of the Bar in detail on the point raised by\n",
      "them in this revision petition. Judgment stand on different footing than the\n",
      "order and the decree. Legislature in its wisdom has avoided the use of word\n",
      "'formal expression' in the definition of the judgment as used in Sec. 2(9) C.P.C.\n",
      "whereas the word formal expression has been used in the definition of the\n",
      "decree as defined under section 2 (2) as well as in the definition of the order as\n",
      "defined in section 2 (14) of the C.P.C. Similarly it is not \"necessary in a decree\n",
      "that there should be a statement given by the Judge. Statement is to be given\n",
      "by the Judge only in the judgment and he records the reason for arriving at a\n",
      "particular conclusion in the judgment and decree is the formal expression of\n",
      "the conclusions arrived at by the Judge in the judgment. So it is not necessary\n",
      "that there should be a formal expression of the order in the judgment, though\n",
      "it is desirable to be so. From the perusal of the order itself it is clear that the\n",
      "learned Judge has held that the suit is barred by limitation and is liable to be\n",
      "dismissed. The expression of the words' liable to be dismissed' by implication\n",
      "means that the suit is dismissed and it may tent amount the formal expression\n",
      "of the dismissal of the suit, though not said in specific words. The judgment\n",
      "also leads to conclude in its final adjudication as the judge has held that the\n",
      "suit is barred by limitation, and as the suit which is barred by limitation cannot\n",
      "be entertained so, it is natural disposal of the suit and final adjudication of the\n",
      "rights and liabilities of the parties. Thus I am of the view that the judgment\n",
      "should be considered final adjudication of the rights of the parties as for as the\n",
      "suit of the plaintiff is concerned. However, a mistake is there on the part of the\n",
      "court also that the court has not drawn the decree so far. The party cannot be\n",
